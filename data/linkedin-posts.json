Although some still view AI code as a disruptive force and cling to traditional methods, we must remember the valuable lesson from Nokia's engineers who held onto Symbian and eventually lost their edge. Here's how to get started with Claude Code: 1. Install Claude Code globally: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code 2. Get 60 USD in credits from anyrouter.top 3. Navigate to your project and run: claude. I was able to develop my TaxiCarPooling project with ReactNative, Springboot, MySQL in just half a day using Claude Code, all for only 7.4 USD credits! Happy coding & Happy Summer! üöÄ",

Chinese companies often struggle to adapt to overseas markets, and issues like distrust and prejudice create barriers for them as well. Despite the challenges, there's a significant opportunity for collaboration and growth between EU and Chinese companies to bridge the gaps in the electric vehicle (EV) and AI sectors. By combining European automotive heritage with Chinese innovation, the potential for a transformative partnership is vast.",
