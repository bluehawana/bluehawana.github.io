    "content": "üåû Summer Vacation Gift for AI Coding Enthusiasts & Skeptics üíª As we enjoy our well-deserved vacations, let's take a moment to reflect on AI's role in coding. Although some still view AI code as a disruptive force and cling to traditional methods, we must remember the valuable lesson from Nokia's engineers who held onto Symbian and eventually lost their edge. Here's how to get started with Claude Code: 1. Install Claude Code globally: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code 2. Get 60 USD in credits from anyrouter.top 3. Navigate to your project and run: claude. I was able to develop my TaxiCarPooling project with ReactNative, Springboot, MySQL in just half a day using Claude Code, all for only 7.4 USD credits! Happy coding & Happy Summer! üöÄ",

The scholarship covers one training course and a certification exam ‚Äî I'll be going for the CKA Exam first. While preparing in just two weeks feels intense, but I'm ready to give it everything this summer. A huge shout-out to the The Linux Foundation for this wicked opportunity and for supporting the open-source community in such an awesome way. Let's do IT! üêß‚ò∏Ô∏è",

Stay tuned to witness the complete implementation of this hobby project, Bo Sun perhaps it's time we schedule a live demonstration of our workflow to gather some valuable material for our presentation?",

Chinese companies often struggle to adapt to overseas markets, and issues like distrust and prejudice create barriers for them as well. Despite the challenges, there's a significant opportunity for collaboration and growth between EU and Chinese companies to bridge the gaps in the electric vehicle (EV) and AI sectors. By combining European automotive heritage with Chinese innovation, the potential for a transformative partnership is vast.",
