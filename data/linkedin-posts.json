    "content": "💡 Unlocking Company Profits Made Simple!\nEver wondered how a company generates profits? As a stakeholder, employee, client, customer, or curious individual, you don't need specialized knowledge or skills to understand financial reports. All you need is the company's financial report (yearly or quarterly) and some tools like #GoogleAIStudio, #NanoBananaPro and the inspiration from www.voronoi.com as well.\nLet's use Volvo Cars' Q3 2025 report as an example. By inputting the data into the AI platform, you can create a visual representation of how Volvo Cars made money in Q3 2025, similar to the provided image of Nvidia.\nThis era of #AI empowers us to overcome many barriers like Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Frontend Development, UX/UI, and more. Now, when your boss asks about the company's revenue sources and expenses, you have a clear and visually engaging answer.\n\nResources:\nVolvo Cars Q3 2025 Report: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dsSPzzNf\nVoronoiApp: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dECJEYnT\n\n#GoogleAIStudio #VoronoiApp #Nvidia #NanoBananaPro",

    "content": "Tonight, I successfully renewed my Finansiell ID-Teknik - BankID  using the SEB mobile app in just 25 seconds. I was prompted to do so because my BankID was about to expire in 57 days. However, my wife is facing issues installing BankID on her new #iPhone17 due to a defect in the ICA Banken's app on #iPhoneX. We contacted ICA Banken's call center, and they asked us to wait for an in-app message. Unfortunately, after two weeks waiting, with their instructions, we're still stuck in a loop when trying to sign with BankID for authenticating the installation of new BankID on new iPhone, basically nothing being changed. Following the call center's suggestion, we booked an appointment with SEB tomorrow. We might have to close our ICA Banken account, as they don't seem to care about our issue and advised us to find a bank with a physical office.\nSometimes, businesses overlook customer complaints about their products or services, believing that losing one customer isn't a big deal. However, the negative impact of such experiences goes beyond just one customer, as it spreads through word-of-mouth and online reviews.\nWith virtual banks like Revolut emerging, the advantages of traditional banks are becoming less obvious. When customers are charged 20 SEK per month and find that their app isn't compatible with new devices, it's only natural for them to switch to other banks. \nThis experience serves as a reminder that businesses can't afford to become complacent. Failing to continuously improve products and services will inevitably result in losing customers, as they seek better alternatives. Ultimately, prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying ahead of the competition are key to long-term success.\n\n#ICABanken #BankID #SEB #Revolution #CustomerService",

But their focus is different:\n• \tDGX Spark is clearly aimed at professionals running heavy AI/ML workloads. The extra RAM and storage make it a specialized tool for model training and large‑scale experiments.\n• \tMac mini M4 Pro is an all‑rounder. It’s perfect for those who want a premium desktop that handles everyday tasks effortlessly while still being capable of serious compute work. The Apple ecosystem and macOS polish make it a smooth experience.\n💡 So which one makes sense?\n• \tIf your priority is intensive AI/ML modeling, DGX Spark is the better fit.\n• \tIf you want a versatile, user‑friendly system that balances performance with everyday usability, the Mac mini M4 Pro is hard to beat.\nFor me personally, I don’t see a reason to choose the DGX Spark at this price point. There are more cost‑effective alternatives out there — for example:\n👉 https://lnkd.in/dmrJ-pjp\nDon’t get blinded by the NVIDIA halo effect. Choose what truly fits your needs.

However, upon further experience, I discovered that their business practices involve questionable methods, such as using customers' funds without permission to purchase Revolut points.\nIt's disheartening to see a fintech company that has grown from a startup to a widely used online bank resort to earning profits in this manner. Despite receiving a refund, I will continue to monitor my account closely. If this issue persists, I will update this post and remove all my assets from Revolut, ultimately adding them to my blocked list.\n\nSome updates so far on 14th of Oct. I have got my fully refund from Revolut promptly，even earlier than my reply in this post. #Kudos to their customer service for their swift response and commitment to resolving the issue. While my experience wasn't ideal this time, Revolut remains a standout fintech company, offering support for #ApplePay, #GooglePay, #SamsungPay, and more through their visual cards. Most people appreciate the convenience of having a digital wallet on their phones, and Revolut fits the bill, especially for those who don't want to link their main bank accounts directly to Apple or Google Pay.\n\nWhat's more, their <18 feature allows you to apply and manage a kid's visual card through Revolut App from your own account – a game-changer for parents like us without local country‘s citizenship or passports.

Instead, it uses a modular \"unboxed\" architecture where vehicle components are built in parallel sub-assembly lines as independent modules (e.g., front, rear, underbody with battery, and sides/roof). These modules are pre-assembled, \"decorated\" (e.g., painted or finished), and then integrated in a final \"mainline\" step. This reduces sequential dependencies, enabling:\nParallel processing to cut cycle times.\nReduced factory footprint by up to 40%.\nCost savings of 30-50% per vehicle through fewer parts, less material waste, and automation-friendly designs. The process integrates Tesla's giga-casting (large single-piece castings for underbody) and structural battery packs, allowing seats and wiring to be installed directly on modules before final joining.",

Through relentless performance tuning and strategic hardware optimization on our on-premise Dell HPC, our dream team of hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, and system architects just accomplished what many deemed impossible:\n\n📈 The fastest #Android15AOSP clean build time on the #BareMetal we've ever achieved.\nLet the numbers do the talking:\nOur breakthrough: 7.78 minutes ⚡\nPrevious baseline: 27 minutes (3.5x improvement!)\n#Google's official benchmark: ~40 minutes (72 cores + 64GB RAM)\n#Azure VM HB120rs_v3 (their best): ~20.18 minutes (AMD EPYC 7V73X, 120 vCPUs, 448GB HBM2, 350GB/s memory bandwidth + Premium NVMe + InfiniBand HDR networking)\n\nWe didn't just beat #Azure's flagship HPC instance — we CRUSHED it by 259%! 💪 Here's the kicker: Our previous virtualized results with #VMware were trailing behind Azure significantly. Now? We've leapfrogged them entirely through pure engineering excellence.\nThe secret sauce? Well, like any five-star chef's recipe, that stays in the vault：）But here's the gist — it's not about throwing expensive hardware at the problem. It's about dissecting every layer of the stack and optimizing with surgical precision.\n\nWhy This Matters: #Tesla didn't become the EV leader by just matching competitors — they made their cars cooler, smarter, and more advanced. Similarly, we're not just optimizing build times; we're redefining what's possible in our development pipeline and setting up our own private cloud in our #DataCenter as well.\nAs the Olympic motto says: Citius, Altius, Fortius — Faster, Higher, Stronger. There are no shortcuts to peak performance, only dedication to excellence.\nReady to transform your development velocity? The future of high-performance computing isn't in the cloud — it's in knowing how to make silicon sing.\n\nP.S. — The visualization of #TeslaMCU3 was crafted using advanced prompts +#GeminiNanoBanana.

I was prompted to do so because my BankID was about to expire in 57 days. However, my wife is facing issues installing BankID on her new #iPhone17 due to a defect in the ICA Banken's app on #iPhoneX. We contacted ICA Banken's call center, and they asked us to wait for an in-app message. Unfortunately, after two weeks waiting, with their instructions, we're still stuck in a loop when trying to sign with BankID for authenticating the installation of new BankID on new iPhone, basically nothing being changed. Following the call center's suggestion, we booked an appointment with SEB tomorrow. We might have to close our ICA Banken account, as they don't seem to care about our issue and advised us to find a bank with a physical office.\nSometimes, businesses overlook customer complaints about their products or services, believing that losing one customer isn't a big deal. However, the negative impact of such experiences goes beyond just one customer, as it spreads through word-of-mouth and online reviews.\nWith virtual banks like Revolut emerging, the advantages of traditional banks are becoming less obvious. When customers are charged 20 SEK per month and find that their app isn't compatible with new devices, it's only natural for them to switch to other banks. \nThis experience serves as a reminder that businesses can't afford to become complacent. Failing to continuously improve products and services will inevitably result in losing customers, as they seek better alternatives. Ultimately, prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying ahead of the competition are key to long-term success.\n\n#ICABanken #BankID #SEB #Revolution #CustomerService",

Instead, it uses a modular \"unboxed\" architecture where vehicle components are built in parallel sub-assembly lines as independent modules (e.g., front, rear, underbody with battery, and sides/roof). These modules are pre-assembled, \"decorated\" (e.g., painted or finished), and then integrated in a final \"mainline\" step. This reduces sequential dependencies, enabling:\nParallel processing to cut cycle times.\nReduced factory footprint by up to 40%.\nCost savings of 30-50% per vehicle through fewer parts, less material waste, and automation-friendly designs.

However, people often opt for virtualized environments like vSphere, AKS, EKS, or GKE due to the comfort and familiarity these platforms offer.

Through relentless performance tuning and strategic hardware optimization on our on-premise Dell HPC, our dream team of hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, and system architects just accomplished what many deemed impossible:\n\n📈 The fastest #Android15AOSP clean build time on the #BareMetal we've ever achieved.\nLet the numbers do the talking:\nOur breakthrough: 7.78 minutes ⚡\nPrevious baseline: 27 minutes (3.5x improvement!)\n#Google's official benchmark: ~40 minutes (72 cores + 64GB RAM)\n#Azure VM HB120rs_v3 (their best): ~20.18 minutes (AMD EPYC 7V73X, 120 vCPUs, 448GB HBM2, 350GB/s memory bandwidth + Premium NVMe + InfiniBand HDR networking)\n\nWe didn't just beat #Azure's flagship HPC instance — we CRUSHED it by 259%! 💪 Here's the kicker: Our previous virtualized results with #VMware were trailing behind Azure significantly. Now? We've leapfrogged them entirely through pure engineering excellence.\nThe secret sauce? Well, like any five-star chef's recipe, that stays in the vault：）But here's the gist — it's not about throwing expensive hardware at the problem. It's about dissecting every layer of the stack and optimizing with surgical precision.\n\nWhy This Matters: #Tesla didn't become the EV leader by just matching competitors — they made their cars cooler, smarter, and more advanced. Similarly, we're not just optimizing build times; we're redefining what's possible in our development pipeline and setting up our own private cloud in our #DataCenter as well.\nAs the Olympic motto says: Citius, Altius, Fortius — Faster, Higher, Stronger. There are no shortcuts to peak performance, only dedication to excellence.\nReady to transform your development velocity? The future of high-performance computing isn't in the cloud — it's in knowing how to make silicon sing.\n\nP.S. — The visualization of #TeslaMCU3 was crafted using advanced prompts +#GeminiNanoBanana. Like our optimization techniques, some secrets are meant to be sensed, not explained. \n\n#Android15 #DellServer #HPC #AOSP #PerformanceTuning #DevOps  #AndroidAuto #TechInnovation #BuildOptimization #AzureAKS #GCP #HybridCloud #PrivateCloud #TeslaMCU #AMDRyzen",

    "content": "iPad Remote Development - No SSH or Terminal Apps Required\n\nHej,\nHope you all had a great Christmas. As a New Year's gift to the dev community, I want to share something I've been working on.\n\nToday I successfully connected to my VPS from my iPad Pro Gen 3 and started coding - directly from Safari. No SSH apps, no terminal emulators, just a browser.\n\nTested over Tele2 cellular 4G connection - proving this works anywhere you have mobile data.\n\nSolving iPad's Development Problem\n\nThe main reasons developers avoid iPad for serious work:\n- No proper terminal tools\n- Limited code IDE support\n- Poor SSH connection options\n- iOS sandboxing restrictions\n\nThis project solves all of these by moving the development environment to a server and accessing it through Safari. Now your iPad becomes a true development machine.\n\n What Works\n\n - Full terminal access in Safari\n - Git workflow (commit, push, PR creation)\n - File editing with vim/nano\n - AI-assisted coding (OpenAI integration)\n - Virtual keyboard optimized for touch\n - Sessions persist across disconnects\n - MFA with Google Authenticator for highest security\n\nBuilt with Kiro and Claude Code Sonnet 4.5\n\nThis entire project was built using Kiro and Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 - proving that AI-assisted development can create real, production-ready tools. Now it enables vibe coding anywhere you have your iPad and internet connection. Coffee shop, airport, wherever - just open Safari and code.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n The iPad Pro has the hardware for serious development work, but iOS limitations have always been the blocker. By running the dev environment on a server and accessing through Safari, we bypass those limitations completely.\n\nYou get:\n- Full Linux environment\n- All your command-line tools\n- Your entire workflow, just accessible from anywhere\n- No need to carry a laptop\n- Secure access with multi-factor authentication\n\nTechnical Stack\n\n- WebSocket for real-time communication\n- xterm.js for browser terminal\n- node-pty for shell management\n- TypeScript monorepo\n- PWA support\n- TOTP-based MFA (Google Authenticator)\n\nNext Steps\n\nI'm developing several deployment scenarios for devs with(out) a VPS:\n\n1. With VPS (what I'm using now)\n2. Tailscale VPN (connect iPad to your Mac at home, no VPS needed)\n3. Cloudflare Tunnel (permanent setup with custom domain)\n4. ngrok (quick testing)\n5. GitHub Codespaces (backup option)\n\nFor developers without a VPS, options 2-5 mean you can still work remotely with just your Mac at home and your iPad.\n\nOpen Source\n\nWill be releasing this for the community soon. Whether you have a VPS, a Mac at home, or just use Codespaces - you'll be able to vibe code from your iPad anywhere you have internet. Forget your MBP and MBA, now in 2026, it is time to work from anywhere with just an iPad.\n\n Interested in trying this?

If you must drive and your vehicle is a two‑wheel‑drive automatic model from the last ten years, remember to shift to M and lock it in M2 for better traction compared to D. For older automatic vehicles, look for L2 and use that to drive out of deep snow. And if your car only has D… well, good luck 😄\nFor manual‑transmission cars, try starting in 2nd gear when moving out of deep snow. If 1st gear causes too much wheel spin or doesn’t give you enough controlled power, 2nd gear often provides smoother traction and helps the car move forward more steadily.\n\nWhen driving out of snow, keep your speed low until the wheels stop slipping, then continue smoothly at a controlled pace. For safer winter driving, preheat your front window and take extra time to thoroughly clear all windows. Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and use gradual braking instead of sudden stops. These small habits significantly improve visibility and reduce the risk of accidents on slippery roads.\n\nThese tips come from 30+ years behind the wheel both in China and Sweden. Put them to the test again today helping a rear-wheel-drive BMW 5 Series and a front-wheel-drive XC60 get unstuck from the snow.

Now helping millions of SME owners do the same.\nYou know that monthly torture? Collecting payment records from Stripe, foodora, UberEat, Wolt... hunting down matching invoices... printing everything... then doing it all over again next month?\nI was done with it. So I built an Invoice Handling System that does this automatically.\nWhat it does:\n\nOCR scans and recognizes payments that need invoices\nPython connects different platform APIs to fetch correct invoices with proper format and numbers\nPrints everything automatically\n\nWhy I built this:\nMy wife runs a restaurant in Sweden. Every month, the same boring invoice work falls on me. I wanted to give this time back—to all SME owners—time to sleep, think about business strategy, maybe even relax.\nIf this helps some of #SMEs save hours every month on accounting prep, that's real impact.\nMy principle:\nA working solution beats perfect theory. A shabby “One”that solves real problems > a perfect “Zero” that never ships. Just keep building and committing.\n\n#Python #OCR #API #Stripe #Foodora #UberEats #Wolt #Automation #SME #RealProblems",

Now helping millions of SME owners do the same.\nYou know that monthly torture? Collecting payment records from Stripe , foodora, UberEat, Wolt … hunting down matching invoices… printing everything… then doing it all over again next month?\nI was done with it. So I built an Invoice Handling System that does this automatically.\nWhat it does:\n\t∙\tOCR scans and recognizes payments that need invoices\n\t∙\tPython connects different platform APIs to fetch correct invoices with proper format and numbers, some of them from our Gmail :)\n\t∙\tFetches everything to our dashboard where users can review and select what to print\nNow all payments from Stripe, UberEats, Foodora, Wolt are automated. Next step: SEB API and auth key integration for printing monthly reports and details of Bankgiro payments (more than one at a time).\nWhy I built this:\nMy wife runs a restaurant in Sweden. Every month, the same boring invoice work falls on me. I wanted to give this time back—to all SME owners—time to sleep, think about business strategy, maybe even relax.\nIf this helps some #SMEs save hours every month on accounting prep, that’s real impact.\nMy principle:\nA working solution beats perfect theory. A shabby “One” that solves real problems > a perfect “Zero” that never ships. Just keep building and committing.

    "content": "Yesterday I went to a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) meetup about AI in development at Spotify. Great event, lots of energy. But afterwards, I noticed something that's been bothering me.\nAlmost every Swedish company I talk to: Microsoft stack, VS Code, GitHub Copilot. That's it.\nWhen I ask \"why not try Claude, Gemini, or other tools?\", the answer is always: \"data security concerns.\"\nBut here's the thing - most companies already pay for Microsoft and Azure, so they add Copilot for $20/month and feel safe because \"Microsoft will protect our data.\" Is that really security thinking? Or just going with what feels familiar?\nHere's What Nobody's Talking About :\nSome of the best coding models right now are Chinese: #Qwen-3.5-coder (Alibaba), #GLM-4.7 (Zhipu), #MiniMax 2.1 (Xiyu), #Kimi 2.5 (Moonshot). They're top-ranked on Hugging Face and NVIDIA platforms. In many coding tasks, they're genuinely better than Copilot. Significantly better.\nAnd it's not just Chinese models - Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini - nobody's even trying them.\nFrom my experience testing these tools extensively? #Copilot wouldn't even make my top 10. I'm not exaggerating.\nMy Suggestion :\nLook, if you're scared that Chinese AI models will send your data back to China(Maybe not) - fine, I understand that concern. But at least try other American AI giants like #Anthropic's #ClaudeCode, #GoogleGemini & #Antigravity, #AWS #Kiro, or even #OpenAI's #Codex directly instead of staying trapped within Copilot.\nUnless you have factory software locked into Microsoft, why not explore what's actually best for your team?\nMost of these models are easy to access: Ollama (local) or on cloud, OpenAI-compatible APIs, NVIDIA catalog, many with free tiers. Take your actual code, run tests, compare. Then decide based on performance, not on \"this is what other Swedish companies use.\"\nA Personal Note\nI'm from China, working in tech here in Sweden. I love it here. But sometimes there's this automatic assumption: Chinese technology = risky, American technology = safe. That's not how technology works.\nFunny timing though - with all the #Greenland drama lately, suddenly Chinese companies seem a bit more \"acceptable\" in Europe :) \nMaybe it takes geopolitical chaos to remind us that technological diversity isn't just nice to have - it's strategic.\nWhat worries me: what if the US restricts AI services due to geopolitics one day? Shouldn't we at least know what alternatives exist?\nThe \"Can't Live Without AI\" theme from yesterday's meetup is true. AI is part of our work now.\nBut let's make sure we're choosing the right tools, not just the comfortable ones.\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. Maybe I'm too sensitive about the China thing. But I genuinely think we're missing out on better tools because of assumptions we haven't questioned. What do you think? Read the article for more details.\n\n#Antigravity #Kiro #ClaudeCode #DevTools #CNCF #Sweden #CodingIDE #AIModels #Huggingface #Nvidia",
