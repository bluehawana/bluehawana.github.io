# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a fully automated LinkedIn post detection and synchronization system that works like GitHub repository syncing. The system will automatically detect new LinkedIn posts using OAuth authentication and API access, then sync them to the website without any manual intervention. The system will run on a schedule via GitHub Actions and maintain a complete history of all LinkedIn posts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want my LinkedIn posts to automatically sync to my website, so that my blog stays updated without manual work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new LinkedIn post is published THEN the system SHALL detect it within 2 hours
2. WHEN a new post is detected THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding blog post automatically
3. WHEN the sync runs THEN the system SHALL use OAuth authentication to access LinkedIn API
4. WHEN posts are synced THEN the system SHALL preserve all post content, hashtags, and metadata
5. WHEN the sync completes THEN the system SHALL commit changes to the GitHub repository automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use LinkedIn's official API endpoints, so that the integration is reliable and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use the existing OAuth 2.0 access token
2. WHEN fetching posts THEN the system SHALL try multiple LinkedIn API endpoints in priority order
3. IF the primary API endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative endpoints
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL include proper headers and authentication
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL parse different response formats correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the latest LinkedIn posts on the blog, so that I can read the most current content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new posts are synced THEN they SHALL appear in the blog posts section
2. WHEN viewing a synced post THEN it SHALL include the original LinkedIn URL
3. WHEN posts are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain original formatting and hashtags
4. WHEN posts include media THEN the system SHALL preserve media references
5. WHEN posts are created THEN they SHALL include proper Jekyll front matter

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the sync process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sync runs THEN the system SHALL log all API calls and responses
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN the sync completes THEN the system SHALL create a summary report
4. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to avoid duplicate posts, so that my blog doesn't have repeated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for new posts THEN the system SHALL compare against existing post IDs
2. WHEN a post already exists THEN the system SHALL skip creating a duplicate
3. WHEN posts are updated on LinkedIn THEN the system SHALL detect and sync changes
4. WHEN the sync runs THEN the system SHALL maintain a database of synced posts
5. WHEN duplicate detection runs THEN the system SHALL use multiple identification methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want the system to run automatically on a schedule, so that posts sync without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the schedule triggers THEN the system SHALL run every 2 hours during active hours
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL complete within 5 minutes
3. WHEN no new posts exist THEN the system SHALL complete without making changes
4. WHEN new posts are found THEN the system SHALL process them and commit to GitHub
5. WHEN the workflow fails THEN it SHALL retry with exponential backoff
