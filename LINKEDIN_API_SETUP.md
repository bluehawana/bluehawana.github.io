## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Access Token Generation Issue**

### üö® **Postman/Browser Limitation Discovered**
During testing, we discovered that **LinkedIn OAuth authorization cannot be completed through Postman or desktop browsers** due to LinkedIn's security restrictions. 

**Required Solution:**
1. **Use LinkedIn Mobile App** when you receive the authorization email from LinkedIn.com
2. **Complete authorization on mobile device** (iOS/Android LinkedIn app)
3. **Then proceed with token exchange** using Postman/curl

### Root Cause:
- LinkedIn detects automated/non-mobile authorization attempts
- Desktop browsers may trigger additional security checks
- Mobile app authorization is the reliable method

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### OAuth Flow
```javascript
// OAuth 2.0 Authorization URL
const authUrl = `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?` +
  `response_type=code&` +
  `client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&` +
  `redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI)}&` +
  `scope=r_liteprofile%20r_emailaddress%20w_member_social&` +
  `state=${generateState()}`;
```
