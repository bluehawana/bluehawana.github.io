It seems that the golden era for companies like 萬事達卡 , Visa , and American Express to earn easy commission profits might be coming to an end. With increasing choices and opportunities for consumers, the payment industry is undergoing a revolution, driven by innovators like OpenAI & Stripe  or 谷歌  & PayPal. As the public experiences smoother payment processes, the dominance of traditional giants from the Web 2.0 era will gradually diminish, paving the way for a new landscape in the future.
