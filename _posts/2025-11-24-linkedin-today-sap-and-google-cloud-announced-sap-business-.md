Today, SAP and Google Cloud announced SAP Business Data Cloud Connect for BigQuery—a new capability that simplifies access to mission-critical SAP data products from SAP Business Data Cloud through bidirectional, zero-copy sharing. Now customers can:

- Build grounded, trustworthy AI by accessing trusted semantically rich SAP data in real-time without copies.
- Deploy autonomous agents using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Gemini that can automate complex cross-functional processes.
- Fuse SAP data through SAP BDC with unique, world-scale datasets only available on Google Cloud, like Google Maps geospatial data, Google Trends, and public datasets, to create unparalleled business context.
- Enable anyone in the organization to ask complex questions of their business data in natural language and get immediate, intelligent answers.

We're making it easy for enterprises to build a unified data foundation that breaks down silos and unlocks a new class of AI agents and applications.
