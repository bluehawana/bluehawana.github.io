There's an intriguing connection between a person's role in a company, their hairline, and the number of screens on their desk. CEOs, who might sport a receding hairline, often use just one device like an iPhone or iPad or a laptop，while developers, known for their diverse hairstyles, usually have multiple screens – sometimes more than 3!

The more monitors you have, the higher the risk of hair loss 😉
