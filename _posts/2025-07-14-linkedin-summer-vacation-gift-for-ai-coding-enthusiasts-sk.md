üåû Summer Vacation Gift for AI Coding Enthusiasts & Skeptics üíª
As we enjoy our well-deserved vacations, let's take a moment to reflect on AI's role in coding. Although some still view AI code as a disruptive force and cling to traditional methods, we must remember the valuable lesson from Nokia's engineers who held onto Symbian and eventually lost their edge. Embracing AI can be a game-changer, enabling programmers to swiftly achieve results and refine their work through iterative testing.
üéÅ Exciting news for my fellow programmers! I'm thrilled to share free access to Claude Code, a powerful AI coding guide. Here's how to get started:

1. Install Claude Code
Install Claude Code globally using the command: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code.

2. Click on the link: https://lnkd.in/g3s6UMc6, and log in with your GitHub account in anyrouter.top to receive 60 USD in Claude Code credits.Then visit the API Token page (https://lnkd.in/gfwp3a-3) and click "Add Token" to generate your ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (starts with sk-).
(If you're in China, register with the AI model Kimi at https://lnkd.in/dauDwmhA to obtain a 2 USD free API token.)

3. Apply Claude Code to Your Projects
Navigate to your project folder and set environment variables using:

cd your-project-folder
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-xxxx
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://anyrouter.top
Run Claude Code with the command: claude.

If you met 401 errors said unavailable tokenÔºåfor Anthropic Claude Pro or Max users should log out of their Claude account with /logout in the terminal before applying their Anthropic Auth Token to avoid conflicts.

Now it's time to enjoy your free access to Claude Code and experience the future of AI-assisted coding. I was able to develop my TaxiCarPooling project with ReactNative,Springboot, MySQL in just half a day using Claude Code, all for only 7.4 USD credits! If you have any questions or feedback on this tutorial, please don't hesitate to reach out. I hope you have an amazing summer vacation, filled with a truly incredible AI coding experience using Claude Code. Happy coding  & Happy Summer! üöÄ
