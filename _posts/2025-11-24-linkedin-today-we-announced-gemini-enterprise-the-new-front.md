Today, we announced Gemini Enterprise - the new front door for AI in the workplace. 

Gemini Enterprise brings the best of Google AI to every employee through an intuitive chat interface that unifies six core components -

- A platform powered by Google’s most advanced Gemini models, providing world-class intelligence for every task;
- A no-code workbench that lets any user across the organization analyze information and orchestrate agents to automate processes;
- A suite of pre-built Google agents for specialized jobs;
- Secure connection to your company’s data wherever it lives – from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 to business applications like Salesforce and SAP;
- A central governance framework so you can visualize, secure and audit all of your agents from one place;
- All built on a principle of openness with an ecosystem of over 100,000 partners, ensuring customer choice and fostering innovation.

We shared a number of new capabilities across Workspace, Customer Engagement Suite, and new learning resources. Read more on our blog: https://lnkd.in/gyHcrmSU
