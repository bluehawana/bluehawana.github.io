New Year New Project: No.6 — SSH From Anywhere — With Zero Exposed Ports

This initiative focuses on enhancing security through a zero-trust approach, utilizing tools like Cloudflare Zero Trust and Tailscale. It aims to improve remote access capabilities while ensuring robust cybersecurity measures are in place.

Key components of the project include:
- Leveraging SSH for secure connections
- Ensuring no ports are exposed to the internet
- Implementing mobile-first solutions for access on devices like iPhone
- Utilizing tmux for efficient session management
- Configuring a Mac Mini as a remote access server

Looking forward to sharing insights and progress on this journey!
