At our Brazil Cloud Summit earlier this week, we showcased how we’re enabling organizations to innovate with our most advanced AI technologies and announced:

- Our 6th generation TPU, Trillium, is now available for the Sao Paolo cloud region, enabling Brazilian organizations to run apps like Gemini and their own AI workloads with even lower latency, which is critical for AI inference;
- Gemini on Google Distributed Cloud is now available in Brazil, giving organizations the full power of Gemini models while keeping their sensitive data under their control and in their own data center; 
- A number of customers are using Agentspace to transform their work, like Rede Américas, who is automating contract analysis across its hospitals, and EBANX, who is creating agents to answer complex payment questions;
- Speech translation in Google Meet is now available in Alpha for business customers in Brazil, aimed at helping Brazilians break down language barriers to do business globally;
- We’ve created a new "Gemini for Government" offering to help government agencies accelerate their adoption of AI, enhance services for citizens, and improve operational efficiency; 
- And our new partnerships with Accenture, Deloitte, PwC and Tata Consultancy Services will bring more AI expertise, training, and implementation capacity to Brazilian customers.
