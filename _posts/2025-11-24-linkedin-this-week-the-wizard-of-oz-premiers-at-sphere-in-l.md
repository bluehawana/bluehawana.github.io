This week, the Wizard of Oz premiers at Sphere in Las Vegas, showcasing how Google's generative AI models —Imagen, Veo, and Gemini—are transforming entertainment technology in a close partnership with Sphere Entertainment Co. and Warner Bros. Discovery.

This project highlights the power of AI to overcome immense technical challenges, like upscaling 35mm film to 16K resolution and expanding scenes with "AI outpainting."
