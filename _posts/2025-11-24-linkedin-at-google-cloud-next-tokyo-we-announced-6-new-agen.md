At Google Cloud Next Tokyo, we announced 6 new agents for data and coding. 

For data workers, 5 new agents will help automate tedious tasks like data preparation and migration, and allow you to get answers from your data using natural language. Read the details on our blog: https://lnkd.in/g2TWkKhK 

And for developers, we’ve launched Gemini CLI GitHub Actions, an AI coding teammate that can perform routine tasks autonomously like prioritizing incoming issues and reviewing pull requests, and work with you on things like writing tests and fixing bugs. Give a try at GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gPWPrg6M
