美国联合包裹服务. The worst express service I've ever had. It took 4 days from Shenzhen, China to Sweden—impressive efficiency, right? But in Mölndal, things took a turn for the worse. After waiting 2 days, the driver got lost and then tried to leave my parcel at a candy shop just 30 meters from my home. They texted me saying they couldn't deliver it directly to me.

If you have options, never choose #UPS, even if you're 苹果公司 .
