As market followers, we believed our pace was fast enough. However, Tesla continues to rapidly innovate, with their new patent—automated assembly of external vehicle parts using a global datum—set to significantly reduce production costs and boost efficiency. This further highlights Tesla's leading edge. For us as followers, merely increasing speed is not enough; we need genuine innovation, inside and out, to challenge Tesla 's dominance.
