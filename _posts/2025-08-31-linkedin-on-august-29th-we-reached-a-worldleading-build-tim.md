On August 29th, we reached a world-leading build time record for #Android15 AOSP clean build, which now ranks among the top 10% globally. Our achievement significantly surpasses Google's official speeds and those of Azure VMs. Stay tuned for a detailed post about our journey from VMware vSphere to Bare Metal and how we crushed the fastest record. What's our next stop? Perhaps a local on-premise Kubernetes setup?
As a token of appreciation, we're sharing a special prompt for #NanoBanana, the hottest Text-to-Photo model by #Google #Gemini. Use this prompt to transform the photo: "Create a character figure from this image. Place a box featuring the character's image behind it and a computer displaying the Blender modeling process on its screen. Add a round plastic base in front of the box with the character figure standing on it. Ensure the PVC material appears clear, and set the scene indoors if possible."
Keep an eye on this post for more exciting updates!
