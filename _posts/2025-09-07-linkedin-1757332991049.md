ðŸ’¡ Working on automated content synchronization between LinkedIn and my personal website.

The challenge: LinkedIn's API has restricted access to post reading, even with proper OAuth tokens. 

The solution: Hybrid approach combining:
- OAuth authentication for profile verification
- Alternative methods for post content detection
- Automated blog post generation
- GitHub Actions for scheduling

This creates a fully automated pipeline that respects API limitations while achieving the goal.
