There’s been a lot of buzz around NVIDIA DGX Spark since October 15th, so let’s talk about two compact #BareMetals that keep coming up in comparison: NVIDIA’s DGX Spark and Apple’s Mac mini M4 Pro.
Here are my observations:
🔹 Mac mini M4 Pro
• 	64GB unified memory
• 	macOS 26 “Tahoe”
• 	Seamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem
• 	Compact, quiet, and versatile
🔹 NVIDIA DGX Spark
• 	128GB RAM
• 	4TB SSD
• 	~273GB/s memory bandwidth
• 	Runs a customized Ubuntu 24 Linux OS
Both machines deliver impressive AI performance (roughly comparable to an RTX 3090 Ti in some scenarios). But their focus is different:
• 	DGX Spark is clearly aimed at professionals running heavy AI/ML workloads. The extra RAM and storage make it a specialized tool for model training and large‑scale experiments.
• 	Mac mini M4 Pro is an all‑rounder. It’s perfect for those who want a premium desktop that handles everyday tasks effortlessly while still being capable of serious compute work. The Apple ecosystem and macOS polish make it a smooth experience.
💡 So which one makes sense?
• 	If your priority is intensive AI/ML modeling, DGX Spark is the better fit.
• 	If you want a versatile, user‑friendly system that balances performance with everyday usability, the Mac mini M4 Pro is hard to beat.
For me personally, I don’t see a reason to choose the DGX Spark at this price point. There are more cost‑effective alternatives out there — for example:

Don’t get blinded by the NVIDIA halo effect. Choose what truly fits your needs. If it were up to me, I’d go with the Mac mini M4 Pro (64GB / 2TB).
