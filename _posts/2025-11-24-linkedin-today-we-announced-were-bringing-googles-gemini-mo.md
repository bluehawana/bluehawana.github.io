Today we announced we’re bringing Google's Gemini models to Oracle customers through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI service. OCI customers can access Gemini models via Vertex AI on GCP, making it easier for our joint customers to use generative AI more seamlessly. Customers can leverage Gemini's advanced capabilities within their existing workflows and build AI agents for a variety of tasks using the same system of Oracle cloud credits they use to pay for Oracle services.

Looking forward to seeing the innovation our joint customers will drive with these new capabilities. https://lnkd.in/gT6q7Tr4
