Bare metal servers are indeed the best practice for many scenarios. However, people often opt for virtualized environments like vSphere, AKS, EKS, or GKE due to the comfort and familiarity these platforms offer. It's important to note, though, that this convenience comes with a higher cost. Cloud service providers such as Azure, AWS, and GCP capitalize on this preference, generating substantial profits from customers who value ease of use and stickiness over bare metal solutions.
