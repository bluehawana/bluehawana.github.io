Cladue Code has already changed the whole software industry with the revolution of "vibe coding." Previously, time was wasted in sprint meetings and sorting out Agile things, and it took forever to get hands-on coding – maybe two months later! Now, with Cladue Code, one developer could be a designer, full-stack developer, product owner, product manager, or even a DevOps in a few days. If you are an independent developer, you can publish on Google Play Store or App Store directly and get paid users from all over the world. The world has changed so much during your summer semester, so now is the time to understand what happened by knowing Anthropic Claude Code first.
