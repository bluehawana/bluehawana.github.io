Last week in Singapore we highlighted how some of the top local companies are using our AI solutions to create next-generation customer experiences:

- FairPrice Group is using Google Cloud technologies at its gen-AI powered ‘Store of Tomorrow’ - a supermarket that delivers unique and personalized experiences to shoppers. 
- DBS Bank is using Customer Engagement Suite to reduce customer call handling times by an impressive 20%.
 
We also shared that leading public sector agencies including the Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT), GovTech Singapore, and HTX (Home Team Science & Technology Agency) will be the first in Asia to access Gemini on GDC air-gapped.

All of this is possible because of Google Cloud’s leading AI capabilities that no one else offers. We announced:  

- Customers globally can now leverage the power of Gemini on-premises and at the edge with Gemini on GDC: https://lnkd.in/gvf7ixaR 
- Customers in Singapore have full control with data residency for Gemini 2.5 Flash and Vertex AI Search – both data stored at rest and now machine learning processing, allowing them to innovate to the fullest extent in the public cloud. 
- Customers have access to helpful new tools in Google Vids, our newest Workspace app that lets people create, edit, and share rich video content.
