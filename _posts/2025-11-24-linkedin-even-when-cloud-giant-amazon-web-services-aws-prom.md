Even when Cloud giant Amazon Web Services (AWS) promises 99.99% uptime, that 0.01% downtime can still significantly impact the public. Sure, Duolingo being temporarily unavailable might not matter to some, but imagine holding Amazon Web Services (AWS) stocks on Robinhood and wanting to sell during a dip at the same time. A grain of sand in one era can grow into a mountain of trouble for a family.Isn’t it time we asked ourselves: Why place all our eggs in a single cloud provider’s basket?
When will our private clouds rise to the occasion and come to the rescue?
