🚀 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! 
As promised, here are the results that left the team speechless. Through relentless performance tuning and strategic hardware optimization on our on-premise Dell HPC, our dream team of hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, and system architects just accomplished what many deemed impossible:

📈 The fastest #Android15AOSP clean build time on the #BareMetal we've ever achieved.
Let the numbers do the talking:
Our breakthrough: 7.78 minutes ⚡
Previous baseline: 27 minutes (3.5x improvement!)
#Google's official benchmark: ~40 minutes (72 cores + 64GB RAM)
#Azure VM HB120rs_v3 (their best): ~20.18 minutes (AMD EPYC 7V73X, 120 vCPUs, 448GB HBM2, 350GB/s memory bandwidth + Premium NVMe + InfiniBand HDR networking)

We didn't just beat #Azure's flagship HPC instance — we CRUSHED it by 259%! 💪 Here's the kicker: Our previous virtualized results with #VMware were trailing behind Azure significantly. Now? We've leapfrogged them entirely through pure engineering excellence.
The secret sauce? Well, like any five-star chef's recipe, that stays in the vault：）But here's the gist — it's not about throwing expensive hardware at the problem. It's about dissecting every layer of the stack and optimizing with surgical precision.

Why This Matters: #Tesla didn't become the EV leader by just matching competitors — they made their cars cooler, smarter, and more advanced. Similarly, we're not just optimizing build times; we're redefining what's possible in our development pipeline and setting up our own private cloud in our #DataCenter as well.
As the Olympic motto says: Citius, Altius, Fortius — Faster, Higher, Stronger. There are no shortcuts to peak performance, only dedication to excellence.
Ready to transform your development velocity? The future of high-performance computing isn't in the cloud — it's in knowing how to make silicon sing.

P.S. — The visualization of #TeslaMCU3 was crafted using advanced prompts +#GeminiNanoBanana. Like our optimization techniques, some secrets are meant to be sensed, not explained.
