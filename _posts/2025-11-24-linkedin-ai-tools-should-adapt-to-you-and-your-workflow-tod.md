AI tools should adapt to you and your workflow. Today, we're making that a reality for developers with Gemini CLI extensions—a new framework to customize your command-line Gemini agent.

Extensions deliver several benefits:
- They combine all the necessary connections and settings into a single package that can be installed with a simple command.
- They are more than just API connectors; they are pre-configured playbooks that teach Gemini how to use the new tools effectively
- The ability to share these packaged experiences creates a vibrant ecosystem where the community can build and distribute powerful, domain-specific extensions. It’s like an app store for your terminal's AI.

We’re launching with a powerful suite of extensions from Google and industry leaders like Atlassian, Canva, MongoDB, Postman, Shopify, Snyk and Stripe, alongside a collection of useful extensions built by the open-source community.

Anyone can build and share their own extensions, and we look forward to seeing the incredible tools the community creates.
