I initially thought Revolut was an excellent online bank with a user-friendly iOS app and no fees. However, upon further experience, I discovered that their business practices involve questionable methods, such as using customers' funds without permission to purchase Revolut points.
It's disheartening to see a fintech company that has grown from a startup to a widely used online bank resort to earning profits in this manner. Despite receiving a refund, I will continue to monitor my account closely. If this issue persists, I will update this post and remove all my assets from Revolut, ultimately adding them to my blocked list.

Some updates so far on 14th of Oct. I have got my fully refund from Revolut promptly，even earlier than my reply in this post. #Kudos to their customer service for their swift response and commitment to resolving the issue. While my experience wasn't ideal this time, Revolut remains a standout fintech company, offering support for #ApplePay, #GooglePay, #SamsungPay, and more through their visual cards. Most people appreciate the convenience of having a digital wallet on their phones, and Revolut fits the bill, especially for those who don't want to link their main bank accounts directly to Apple or Google Pay.

What's more, their <18 feature allows you to apply and manage a kid's visual card through Revolut App from your own account – a game-changer for parents like us without local country‘s citizenship or passports. Despite any shortcomings, Revolut's innovative spirit is commendable, and I wish them continued success in revolutionizing the virtual finance landscape.
