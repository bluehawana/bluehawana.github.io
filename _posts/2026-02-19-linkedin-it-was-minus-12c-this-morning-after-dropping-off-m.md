It was minus 12°C this morning. After dropping off my kid, I headed straight to Jula for #birdfood — only to find it sold out. Same at Rusta and Bauhaus in Sisjön.  

Finally picked some up at Biltema. But what stayed with me wasn’t the cold — it was seeing a man walking out with both arms full of seed bags, like he wasn’t just feeding his own birds, but half the forest.  

In weather like this, it means something to know so many people are quietly doing their part. No fanfare, no posts — just care, one handful at a time. Every little bit helps them survive the freeze. 🐦❄️
