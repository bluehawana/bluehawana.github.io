Why should kids focus on strengthening their mathematics skills today? 
I came across a fascinating breakdown of the Meta AI team members:
Half of them are from China
Three-quarters hold PhDs, with 70% working as researchers
Two-fifths came from OpenAI, one-fifth from DeepMind, and three-fifths from Scale AI
One-fifth are L8+ level engineers or researchers
Three-quarters are first-generation immigrants
Many of them were champions or medalists in Mathematics Olympiads. üèÜ

This clearly shows that:
A strong foundation in mathematics is invaluable for AI, engineering, and driving future innovation. If your child enjoys problem solving, logic, and abstract thinking, fostering their love for math could pave the way for them to excel in impactful roles within the world of AI and technology. Ultimately, mathematics isn't just about numbers ‚Äì it's about developing a structured thought process and methodologies to tackle the world's most complex problems.
