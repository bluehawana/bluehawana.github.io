Super excited to share that I’ve been selected for the 2025 The Linux Foundation LiFT Scholarship! 🎉

As someone who’s really into Linux and Kubernetes this means a lot. The scholarship covers one training course and a certification exam — I’ll be going for the CKA Exam first.

While preparing in just two weeks feels intense, but I’m ready to give it everything this summer. Or maybe have the opportunity to knock out other two certifications and (hopefully) deserved to take a proper break in this autumn.

A huge shout-out to the The Linux Foundation for this wicked opportunity and for supporting the open-source community in such an awesome way. Let's do IT!🐧☸️
