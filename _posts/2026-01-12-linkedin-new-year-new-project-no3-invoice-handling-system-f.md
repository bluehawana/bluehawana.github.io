New Year, New Project No.3: Invoice Handling System
Finally freed my hands from invoice processing hell. Now helping millions of SME owners do the same.
You know that monthly torture? Collecting payment records from Stripe , foodora, UberEat, Wolt … hunting down matching invoices… printing everything… then doing it all over again next month?
I was done with it. So I built an Invoice Handling System that does this automatically.
What it does:
	∙	OCR scans and recognizes payments that need invoices
	∙	Python connects different platform APIs to fetch correct invoices with proper format and numbers, some of them from our Gmail :)
	∙	Fetches everything to our dashboard where users can review and select what to print
Now all payments from Stripe, UberEats, Foodora, Wolt are automated. Next step: SEB API and auth key integration for printing monthly reports and details of Bankgiro payments (more than one at a time).
Why I built this:
My wife runs a restaurant in Sweden. Every month, the same boring invoice work falls on me. I wanted to give this time back—to all SME owners—time to sleep, think about business strategy, maybe even relax.
If this helps some #SMEs save hours every month on accounting prep, that’s real impact.
My principle:
A working solution beats perfect theory. A shabby “One” that solves real problems > a perfect “Zero” that never ships. Just keep building and committing. This is what #FinTech is really about.
