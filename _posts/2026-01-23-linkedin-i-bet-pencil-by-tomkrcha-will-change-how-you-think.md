I bet Pencil by TomKrcha will change how you think about #UXUI design. It’s a fresh, interactive tool that lets you design and edit websites, dashboards, and interfaces in real time — either by typing prompts or by manually tweaking elements. Think of it as a live, hands‑on rethink of the design workflow: build something with a prompt, then refine it instantly with direct manipulation.
Why it feels different
Real‑time iteration — no long handoffs between design and prototyping; you see changes as you make them.
Prompt + polish — start with natural language, then fine‑tune visually; great for rapid exploration.
Not a Figma clone — it’s an alternative mindset: more interactive, more experimental, more immediate.
Short learning curve, big payoff — it takes a minute to get used to, but once you do it speeds up ideation and reduces friction.
Try it
Give www.pencil.dev a spin — play with a prompt, tweak the UI, and see how fast you can go from idea to a working interface. If you’re into fast iteration and new design vibes, this one’s worth your time.
