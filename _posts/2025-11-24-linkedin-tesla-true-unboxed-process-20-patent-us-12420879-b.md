#Tesla "True Unboxed Process 2.0" patent (US 12420879 B1) 
was granted and published today.
We are moving closer and closer to the real-life mass production of Matchbox cars. 

Abstract/Summary: The patent describes a revolutionary departure from traditional linear assembly lines (e.g., Ford's conveyor-belt model). Instead, it uses a modular "unboxed" architecture where vehicle components are built in parallel sub-assembly lines as independent modules (e.g., front, rear, underbody with battery, and sides/roof). These modules are pre-assembled, "decorated" (e.g., painted or finished), and then integrated in a final "mainline" step. This reduces sequential dependencies, enabling:
Parallel processing to cut cycle times.
Reduced factory footprint by up to 40%.
Cost savings of 30-50% per vehicle through fewer parts, less material waste, and automation-friendly designs. The process integrates Tesla's giga-casting (large single-piece castings for underbody) and structural battery packs, allowing seats and wiring to be installed directly on modules before final joining.
