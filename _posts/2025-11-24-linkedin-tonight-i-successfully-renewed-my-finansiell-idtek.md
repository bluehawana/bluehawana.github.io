Tonight, I successfully renewed my Finansiell ID-Teknik - BankID  using the SEB mobile app in just 25 seconds. I was prompted to do so because my BankID was about to expire in 57 days. However, my wife is facing issues installing BankID on her new #iPhone17 due to a defect in the ICA Banken's app on #iPhoneX. We contacted ICA Banken's call center, and they asked us to wait for an in-app message. Unfortunately, after two weeks waiting, with their instructions, we're still stuck in a loop when trying to sign with BankID for authenticating the installation of new BankID on new iPhone, basically nothing being changed. Following the call center's suggestion, we booked an appointment with SEB tomorrow. We might have to close our ICA Banken account, as they don't seem to care about our issue and advised us to find a bank with a physical office.
Sometimes, businesses overlook customer complaints about their products or services, believing that losing one customer isn't a big deal. However, the negative impact of such experiences goes beyond just one customer, as it spreads through word-of-mouth and online reviews.
With virtual banks like Revolut emerging, the advantages of traditional banks are becoming less obvious. When customers are charged 20 SEK per month and find that their app isn't compatible with new devices, it's only natural for them to switch to other banks. 
This experience serves as a reminder that businesses can't afford to become complacent. Failing to continuously improve products and services will inevitably result in losing customers, as they seek better alternatives. Ultimately, prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying ahead of the competition are key to long-term success.
