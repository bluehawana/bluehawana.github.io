Testing isn't boring when you're ensuring quality for every user.

Even for personal projects, user experience matters. So I did what needed to be done: tested all 182 models on NVIDIA's NIM platform.

The results? ✅ 113 out of 182 models (62%) work perfectly with chat and conversation ❌ 69 require paid tier or special access

This means users of my free trial at models.bluehawana.com can now confidently choose from 113 verified working models - no more guessing which ones will fail.

Why this matters:

Transparency builds trust
Users save time (no trial and error)
Clear documentation = better UX
Even side projects deserve quality assurance
The full compatibility report is now in the GitHub repo, so anyone forking or starring the project knows exactly what works.

Because good testing isn't about perfection - it's about knowing your product inside out and being honest about it.
