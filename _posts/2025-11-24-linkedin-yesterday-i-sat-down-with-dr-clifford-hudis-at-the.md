Yesterday I sat down with Dr. Clifford Hudis at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting to discuss the role of AI in oncology. We talked about our recent announcement of the ASCO Guidelines Assistant - a gen AI agent that gives physicians interactive access to clinical guidelines for diagnosing and treating cancer. This is just one example of AI’s potential to free up clinicians so they can focus on patient care.

In the future, we think AI will act as a support system for both doctors and patients, delivering trustworthy and up-to-date information throughout the healthcare journey.
