Learn to build your own voice-activated AI assistant that can execute tasks like gathering recent AI news from the web, scripting out a podcast, and using tools to put all that into a multi-speaker podcast. See our new short course: "Building Live Voice Agents with Google’s ADK (Agent Development Kit),”  taught by Google’s Lavi Nigam and Sita Lakshmi Sangameswaran. 

ADK provides modular components that make it easy to build and debug agents. It also includes a built-in web interface for tracing agentic reasoning. This course illustrates these concepts via  building a live voice agent that can chain actions to complete a complex task like creating a podcast. This requires maintaining context, implementing guardrails, reasoning, and handling audio streaming, while keeping latency low.

You’ll learn to:
- Build voice agents that listen, reason, and respond
- Guide your agent to follow a specific workflow to accomplish a task
- Coordinate specialized agents to build an agentic podcast workflow that researches topics and produces multi-speaker audio
- Understand how to deploy an agent into production

Even if you’re not yet building voice systems, you'll find understanding how realtime agents stream data and maintain reliability useful for designing modern agentic applications.
