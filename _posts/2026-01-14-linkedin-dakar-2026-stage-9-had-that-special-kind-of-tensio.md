Dakar 2026 Stage 9 had that special kind of tension you can feel even through the screen. The gaps between Nani Roma, Cense, and Nassel Al‑Atyeea were razor‑thin — the kind of close fight that reminds you why Dakar is still the toughest race on earth.

This year, there's a significant narrative unfolding: American and European teams are not just participating; they are actively challenging the status quo. Ford Racing and Dacia Sandrider are fully committed to taking on Toyota's long-standing dominance. The momentum is shifting, stage by stage, dune by dune.

A huge respect goes out to all the Dakar legends and every new challenger out there. They’re not just racing machines — they’re carrying the pride of entire engineering cultures, fighting for every second in the desert.they embody the pride of entire engineering cultures, battling for every second in the desert.
