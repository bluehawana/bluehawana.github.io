Where there are dumplings, there’s the spirit of #LunarNewYear. Yesterday, we made them together to celebrate Chinese Lunar New Year’s Eve—a small tradition that brings warmth, no matter how far from home we are.

Wishing all overseas Chinese a joyful and prosperous Year of the Horse.            🐎 年大吉!

Where your family is, there’s your hometown. And when we make dumplings together, it truly feels like the Spring Festival has arrived.

#LunarNewYear #Dumpling #Overseas #SpringFestival
