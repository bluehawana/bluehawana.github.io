      "commentary": "Testing isn't boring when you're ensuring quality for every user.\n\nEven for personal projects, user experience matters. So I did what needed to be done: tested all 182 models on NVIDIA's NIM platform.\n\nThe results? ✅ 113 out of 182 models (62%) work perfectly with chat and conversation ❌ 69 require paid tier or special access\n\nThis means users of my free trial at models.bluehawana.com can now confidently choose from 113 verified working models - no more guessing which ones will fail.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nTransparency builds trust\nUsers save time (no trial and error)\nClear documentation = better UX\nEven side projects deserve quality assurance\nThe full compatibility report is now in the GitHub repo, so anyone forking or starring the project knows exactly what works.\n\nBecause good testing isn't about perfection - it's about knowing your product inside out and being honest about it.\n\n\n#AI #OpenSource #QualityAssurance #NVIDIA #DeveloperTools #BuildInPublic",

      "commentary": "New Year, New Project: No.5 — Claude Code Proxy with NVIDIA Models\n\nWhat if cost wasn't the barrier to exploring the world's most advanced AI models?\nThat's what inspired me to launch Project No.5. After completing projects 1-4, I wanted to take on a bigger challenge: making high-end #AI accessible to anyone curious enough to build.\nMost developers never get to test top-tier models because they're too \"expensive\". Comparing them? Even harder. So people stick with familiar tools like #Copilot, missing out on models that could be faster, sharper, or better suited for specific tasks.\nThe game needs to be changed now.\nIntroducing the #NVIDIANIMProxySwitch —a tool that lets you switch between 182 NVIDIA NIM models in under a second. No restarts, no config edits, no hassle.\nHere's what it offers:\n- Instant model switching (under 1 second)\n- 182 models ready to explore\n- Web UI and REST API\n- Zero downtime\n- Seamless integration with Claude Code\n- Fully open source\nBuilt entirely with Qwen Coder via this project and Kiro, this project is AI helping build AI infrastructure.\nAnd it’s completely free to use with NVIDIA’s NIM API, so you never have to choose between your budget and your curiosity.\nWant to give it a try? Here is the demo for 7 days : models.bluehawana.com\nWould like to have a deep understanding, you can find the repo in the article below. \nFeel free to star it, save it, or open a PR if you’d like to contribute.\nI'm always excited to see what people create when limits disappear.\nFull write-up below: applying API, architecture, testing, setup, and how to get started.\nProject No.5 is just the beginning. It's still early in the year—plenty more to build.\n\n#AI #MachineLearning #NVIDIA #OpenSource #Python #DeveloperTools #NewYearNewProject",

      "commentary": "Yesterday I went to a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) meetup about AI in development at Spotify. Great event, lots of energy. But afterwards, I noticed something that's been bothering me.\nAlmost every Swedish company I talk to: Windows Laptop, Microsoft stack, VS Code, GitHub Copilot. That's it.\nWhen I ask \"Why not try Claude, Gemini or others on Mac?\", the answer is always: \"data security concerns.\"\nBut here's the thing - most companies already pay for Microsoft and Azure, so they add Copilot for $20/month and feel safe because \"Microsoft will protect our data.\" Is that really security thinking? Or just going with what feels familiar?\nHere's What Nobody's Talking About :\nSome of the best coding models right now are Chinese: #Qwen-3.5-coder (Alibaba), #GLM-4.7 (Zhipu), #MiniMax 2.1 (Xiyu), #Kimi 2.5 (Moonshot). They're top-ranked on Hugging Face and NVIDIA platforms. In many coding tasks, they're genuinely better than Copilot. Significantly better.\nAnd it's not just Chinese models - Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini - nobody's even trying them.\nFrom my experience testing these tools extensively? #Copilot wouldn't even make my top 10. I'm not exaggerating.\nMy Suggestion :\nLook, if you're scared that Chinese AI models will send your data back to China(Maybe not) - fine, I understand that concern. But at least try other American AI giants like #Anthropic's #ClaudeCode, #GoogleGemini & #Antigravity, #AWS #Kiro, or even #OpenAI's #Codex directly instead of staying trapped within Copilot.\nUnless you have factory software locked into Microsoft, why not explore what's actually best for your team?\nMost of these models are easy to access: Ollama (local) or on cloud, OpenAI-compatible APIs, NVIDIA catalog, many with free tiers. Take your actual code, run tests, compare. Then decide based on performance, not on \"this is what other Swedish companies use.\"\nA Personal Note\nI'm from China, working in tech here in Sweden. I love it here. But sometimes there's this automatic assumption: Chinese technology = risky, American technology = safe. That's not how technology works.\nFunny timing though - with all the #Greenland drama lately, suddenly Chinese companies seem a bit more \"acceptable\" in Europe :) \nMaybe it takes geopolitical chaos to remind us that technological diversity isn't just nice to have - it's strategic.\nWhat worries me: what if the US restricts AI services due to geopolitics one day? Shouldn't we at least know what alternatives exist?\nThe \"Can't Live Without AI\" theme from yesterday's meetup is true. AI is part of our work now.\nBut let's make sure we're choosing the right tools, not just the comfortable ones.\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. Maybe I'm too sensitive about the China thing. But I genuinely think we're missing out on better tools because of assumptions we haven't questioned. What do you think? Read the article for more details.\n\n#Antigravity #Kiro #ClaudeCode #DevTools #CNCF #Sweden #CodingIDE #AIModels #Huggingface #Nvidia",

      "commentary": "I bet Pencil by TomKrcha will change how you think about #UXUI design. It’s a fresh, interactive tool that lets you design and edit websites, dashboards, and interfaces in real time — either by typing prompts or by manually tweaking elements. Think of it as a live, hands‑on rethink of the design workflow: build something with a prompt, then refine it instantly with direct manipulation.\nWhy it feels different\nReal‑time iteration — no long handoffs between design and prototyping; you see changes as you make them.\nPrompt + polish — start with natural language, then fine‑tune visually; great for rapid exploration.\nNot a Figma clone — it’s an alternative mindset: more interactive, more experimental, more immediate.\nShort learning curve, big payoff — it takes a minute to get used to, but once you do it speeds up ideation and reduces friction.\nTry it\nGive www.pencil.dev a spin — play with a prompt, tweak the UI, and see how fast you can go from idea to a working interface. If you’re into fast iteration and new design vibes, this one’s worth your time. \n\nCheck out Tom Krcha's post on X to learn more about Pencil and its potential to transform UX/UI design: \nResource: https://lnkd.in/erc_A7XB\n\n#DesignTools #UXUI #PencilDev",

      "commentary": "New Year, New Project No.4: Smart Job Application System \n\nSaw a lot of people complaining about companies using AI tools to filter candidates. But why are you still manually preparing resumes? Serious question: What's your way to customize a resume for each job? Manually editing in #Word or simply copying into ChatGPT without additional context? How do you guarantee it passes #ATS screening?\n\nI developed a Smart Job Application System using Python, LaTeX, and LLM. The workflow includes:\n- Paste job — Submit a job URL or full job description into the web app on my #VPS.\n- Analyze JD — The system parses the posting to extract role, responsibilities, keywords, and required skills.\n- Pick LEGO Bricks — Modular “skills & experience” blocks are selected that best match the JD.\n- AI polish — A language model rewrites and tightens each block for clarity, impact, and ATS keyword alignment.\n- Generate PDF — Produce a clean, professional, ATS‑friendly LaTeX/PDF resume in minutes.\n- Result — From “nothing in your folder” to a tailored resume that reads like it was specifically preparied for that job.\n\n#DIY option — Prefer hands‑on? Use Overleaf.com with ATS‑friendly LaTeX templates to reproduce the same output yourself.\n\nBut here’s the bigger truth.\nThe job market is tough. Brutally tough. And for reasons outside our control, some people may never find a traditional employer. That’s why building things—small tools, automations, systems—matters. It’s not just about landing a job. It’s about building leverage.\n\nAs Naval says:\n- Seek wealth, not money or status.\n- Build leverage with code, content, or capital.\n- Develop specific knowledge through genuine curiosity.\n- Think long‑term.\n\nThis project is just one example of that mindset. Curious? If you want to see whether this system fits your needs, DM me. Happy to walk you through it.\nAnd even if the tool isn’t for you, at least read \"The Almanack of Naval Ravikant\". It’s one of the few books that genuinely shifts how you think.\n\n#JobHunting #Python #NextJS #LaTeX #Overleaf #Automation #ATS #Entrepreneurship #Naval #BuildInPublic #RealProblems #AI",

      "commentary": "Dakar 2026 Stage 9 had that special kind of tension you can feel even through the screen. The gaps between Nani Roma, Cense, and Nassel Al‑Atyeea were razor‑thin — the kind of close fight that reminds you why Dakar is still the toughest race on earth.\n\nThis year, there's a significant narrative unfolding: American and European teams are not just participating; they are actively challenging the status quo. Ford Racing and Dacia Sandrider are fully committed to taking on Toyota's long-standing dominance. The momentum is shifting, stage by stage, dune by dune.\n\nA huge respect goes out to all the Dakar legends and every new challenger out there. They’re not just racing machines — they’re carrying the pride of entire engineering cultures, fighting for every second in the desert.they embody the pride of entire engineering cultures, battling for every second in the desert.\n\n#Dakar2026 #DakarRally #RallyRaid #MotorsportLife #FordRacing #DaciaSandrider #ToyotaGazooRacing #ChallengingToyota #RaceForGlory #DakarLegends",

      "commentary": "New Year, New Project No.3: Invoice Handling System\nFinally freed my hands from invoice processing hell. Now helping millions of SME owners do the same.\nYou know that monthly torture? Collecting payment records from Stripe , foodora, UberEat, Wolt … hunting down matching invoices… printing everything… then doing it all over again next month?\nI was done with it. So I built an Invoice Handling System that does this automatically.\nWhat it does:\n\t∙\tOCR scans and recognizes payments that need invoices\n\t∙\tPython connects different platform APIs to fetch correct invoices with proper format and numbers, some of them from our Gmail :)\n\t∙\tFetches everything to our dashboard where users can review and select what to print\nNow all payments from Stripe, UberEats, Foodora, Wolt are automated. Next step: SEB API and auth key integration for printing monthly reports and details of Bankgiro payments (more than one at a time).\nWhy I built this:\nMy wife runs a restaurant in Sweden. Every month, the same boring invoice work falls on me. I wanted to give this time back—to all SME owners—time to sleep, think about business strategy, maybe even relax.\nIf this helps some #SMEs save hours every month on accounting prep, that’s real impact.\nMy principle:\nA working solution beats perfect theory. A shabby “One” that solves real problems > a perfect “Zero” that never ships. Just keep building and committing. This is what #FinTech is really about.\n\n#FinTech #Python #OCR #API #Stripe #Foodora #UberEats #Wolt #Automation #SME #RealProblems",

      "commentary": "Due to the recent extreme snowfall and the challenging road conditions expected tomorrow, considering public transportation for your commute is advisable. If you must drive and your vehicle is a two‑wheel‑drive automatic model from the last ten years, remember to shift to M and lock it in M2 for better traction compared to D. For older automatic vehicles, look for L2 and use that to drive out of deep snow. And if your car only has D… well, good luck 😄\nFor manual‑transmission cars, try starting in 2nd gear when moving out of deep snow. If 1st gear causes too much wheel spin or doesn’t give you enough controlled power, 2nd gear often provides smoother traction and helps the car move forward more steadily.\n\nWhen driving out of snow, keep your speed low until the wheels stop slipping, then continue smoothly at a controlled pace. For safer winter driving, preheat your front window and take extra time to thoroughly clear all windows. Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and use gradual braking instead of sudden stops. These small habits significantly improve visibility and reduce the risk of accidents on slippery roads.\n\nThese tips come from 30+ years behind the wheel both in China and Sweden. Put them to the test again today helping a rear-wheel-drive BMW 5 Series and a front-wheel-drive XC60 get unstuck from the snow. Hope this helps someone stay safe out there this winter.\n\n#WinterDriving #SnowSafety #DrivingTips #VehicleControl #DefensiveDriving #SafeCommute #CommunitySupport #SnowFallWeather #Gothenburg #Mölndal #Lindholmen",

I know the concepts well, but hadn’t actually built anything with them yet.\nAt the same time, my daughter has a competitive math entrance exam in a month. We covered about 65% of the material last year… and we’ve probably forgotten more than that by now : P\nSo I combined both challenges into one project.\nUsing Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Google #Antigravity, I built a full AI math‑grading system in about 3 hours. It takes iPhone photos (HEIC), reads the handwritten exam year, compares her answers against 15 years of past exams (2010–2025), runs everything through an LLM, and gives instant feedback in Swedish. It even exports a PDF for review.\n\nTech stack:\nLangChain LCEL workflow\nVercel AI SDK streaming\nGemini Pro 2.0 Flash\nProvider‑agnostic (OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq)\nNext.js 16, TypeScript, Zod\nLocal RAG built from the exam archives\n\nNow she practices, I snap a photo, and the AI project handles the grading. No more pretending I remember middle‑school math 100% correctly at 11 PM — and I get real hands‑on experience with the exact tools employers keep asking for.\nCurious to hear from others:\nHow do you help your kids prep for exams?\nDevelopers: what real‑world problems have you solved with your own #RAG setups?\nPM if you want to know more about this project, and please feel free to comment, repost, or like if this resonates with your experiences : )\n\n\nResource: https://lnkd.in/eeXjhQKb\n\n#AI #LLM #LangChain #Gemini #VercelAI #BuildInPublic #ParentingInTech #RealWorldAI #RAG",

      "commentary": "iPad Remote Development - No SSH or Terminal Apps Required\n\nHej,\nHope you all had a great Christmas. As a New Year's gift to the dev community, I want to share something I've been working on.\n\nToday I successfully connected to my VPS from my iPad Pro Gen 3 and started coding - directly from Safari. No SSH apps, no terminal emulators, just a browser.\n\nTested over Tele2 cellular 4G connection - proving this works anywhere you have mobile data.\n\nSolving iPad's Development Problem\n\nThe main reasons developers avoid iPad for serious work:\n- No proper terminal tools\n- Limited code IDE support\n- Poor SSH connection options\n- iOS sandboxing restrictions\n\nThis project solves all of these by moving the development environment to a server and accessing it through Safari. Now your iPad becomes a true development machine.\n\n What Works\n\n - Full terminal access in Safari\n - Git workflow (commit, push, PR creation)\n - File editing with vim/nano\n - AI-assisted coding (OpenAI integration)\n - Virtual keyboard optimized for touch\n - Sessions persist across disconnects\n - MFA with Google Authenticator for highest security\n\nBuilt with Kiro and Claude Code Sonnet 4.5\n\nThis entire project was built using Kiro and Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 - proving that AI-assisted development can create real, production-ready tools. Now it enables vibe coding anywhere you have your iPad and internet connection. Coffee shop, airport, wherever - just open Safari and code.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n The iPad Pro has the hardware for serious development work, but iOS limitations have always been the blocker. By running the dev environment on a server and accessing through Safari, we bypass those limitations completely.\n\nYou get:\n- Full Linux environment\n- All your command-line tools\n- Your entire workflow, just accessible from anywhere\n- No need to carry a laptop\n- Secure access with multi-factor authentication\n\nTechnical Stack\n\n- WebSocket for real-time communication\n- xterm.js for browser terminal\n- node-pty for shell management\n- TypeScript monorepo\n- PWA support\n- TOTP-based MFA (Google Authenticator)\n\nNext Steps\n\nI'm developing several deployment scenarios for devs with(out) a VPS:\n\n1. With VPS (what I'm using now)\n2. Tailscale VPN (connect iPad to your Mac at home, no VPS needed)\n3. Cloudflare Tunnel (permanent setup with custom domain)\n4. ngrok (quick testing)\n5. GitHub Codespaces (backup option)\n\nFor developers without a VPS, options 2-5 mean you can still work remotely with just your Mac at home and your iPad.\n\nOpen Source\n\nWill be releasing this for the community soon. Whether you have a VPS, a Mac at home, or just use Codespaces - you'll be able to vibe code from your iPad anywhere you have internet. Forget your MBP and MBA, now in 2026, it is time to work from anywhere with just an iPad.\n\n Interested in trying this? Keep an eye on the updates of this projejct.\n\n#WebDev #iPad #RemoteDev #Opensource #Claudecode #SSH #TCPIP #Terminal",
