      "content": "💡 Unlocking Company Profits Made Simple!\nEver wondered how a company generates profits? As a stakeholder, employee, client, customer, or curious individual, you don't need specialized knowledge or skills to understand financial reports. All you need is the company's financial report (yearly or quarterly) and some tools like #GoogleAIStudio, #NanoBananaPro and the inspiration from www.voronoi.com as well.\nLet's use Volvo Cars' Q3 2025 report as an example. By inputting the data into the AI platform, you can create a visual representation of how Volvo Cars made money in Q3 2025, similar to the provided image of Nvidia.\nThis era of #AI empowers us to overcome many barriers like Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Frontend Development, UX/UI, and more. Now, when your boss asks about the company's revenue sources and expenses, you have a clear and visually engaging answer.\n\nResources:\nVolvo Cars Q3 2025 Report: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dsSPzzNf\nVoronoiApp: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dECJEYnT\n\n#GoogleAIStudio #VoronoiApp #Nvidia #NanoBananaPro",

      "content": "Tonight, I successfully renewed my Finansiell ID-Teknik - BankID  using the SEB mobile app in just 25 seconds. I was prompted to do so because my BankID was about to expire in 57 days. However, my wife is facing issues installing BankID on her new #iPhone17 due to a defect in the ICA Banken's app on #iPhoneX. We contacted ICA Banken's call center, and they asked us to wait for an in-app message. Unfortunately, after two weeks waiting, with their instructions, we're still stuck in a loop when trying to sign with BankID for authenticating the installation of new BankID on new iPhone, basically nothing being changed. Following the call center's suggestion, we booked an appointment with SEB tomorrow. We might have to close our ICA Banken account, as they don't seem to care about our issue and advised us to find a bank with a physical office.\nSometimes, businesses overlook customer complaints about their products or services, believing that losing one customer isn't a big deal. However, the negative impact of such experiences goes beyond just one customer, as it spreads through word-of-mouth and online reviews.\nWith virtual banks like Revolut emerging, the advantages of traditional banks are becoming less obvious. When customers are charged 20 SEK per month and find that their app isn't compatible with new devices, it's only natural for them to switch to other banks. \nThis experience serves as a reminder that businesses can't afford to become complacent. Failing to continuously improve products and services will inevitably result in losing customers, as they seek better alternatives. Ultimately, prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying ahead of the competition are key to long-term success.\n\n#ICABanken #BankID #SEB #Revolution #CustomerService",

      "content": "There’s been a lot of buzz around NVIDIA DGX Spark since October 15th, so let’s talk about two compact #BareMetals that keep coming up in comparison: NVIDIA’s DGX Spark and Apple’s Mac mini M4 Pro.\nHere are my observations:\n🔹 Mac mini M4 Pro\n• \t64GB unified memory\n• \tmacOS 26 “Tahoe”\n• \tSeamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem\n• \tCompact, quiet, and versatile\n🔹 NVIDIA DGX Spark\n• \t128GB RAM\n• \t4TB SSD\n• \t~273GB/s memory bandwidth\n• \tRuns a customized Ubuntu 24 Linux OS\nBoth machines deliver impressive AI performance (roughly comparable to an RTX 3090 Ti in some scenarios). But their focus is different:\n• \tDGX Spark is clearly aimed at professionals running heavy AI/ML workloads. The extra RAM and storage make it a specialized tool for model training and large‑scale experiments.\n• \tMac mini M4 Pro is an all‑rounder. It’s perfect for those who want a premium desktop that handles everyday tasks effortlessly while still being capable of serious compute work. The Apple ecosystem and macOS polish make it a smooth experience.\n💡 So which one makes sense?\n• \tIf your priority is intensive AI/ML modeling, DGX Spark is the better fit.\n• \tIf you want a versatile, user‑friendly system that balances performance with everyday usability, the Mac mini M4 Pro is hard to beat.\nFor me personally, I don’t see a reason to choose the DGX Spark at this price point. There are more cost‑effective alternatives out there — for example:\n👉 https://lnkd.in/dmrJ-pjp\nDon’t get blinded by the NVIDIA halo effect. Choose what truly fits your needs. If it were up to me, I’d go with the Mac mini M4 Pro (64GB / 2TB).\n\nResources:\n1. \thttps://lnkd.in/d7Ct_CFS\n2. \thttps://lnkd.in/dUNNav3T\n\n#NVIDIA #DGXSpark #Apple #MacMiniM4Pro #Ubuntu24 #macOS26Tahoe #MachineLearning #AIHardware",

      "content": "Learn to build your own voice-activated AI assistant that can execute tasks like gathering recent AI news from the web, scripting out a podcast, and using tools to put all that into a multi-speaker podcast. See our new short course: \"Building Live Voice Agents with Google’s ADK (Agent Development Kit),”  taught by Google’s Lavi Nigam and Sita Lakshmi Sangameswaran. \n\nADK provides modular components that make it easy to build and debug agents. It also includes a built-in web interface for tracing agentic reasoning. This course illustrates these concepts via  building a live voice agent that can chain actions to complete a complex task like creating a podcast. This requires maintaining context, implementing guardrails, reasoning, and handling audio streaming, while keeping latency low.\n\nYou’ll learn to:\n- Build voice agents that listen, reason, and respond\n- Guide your agent to follow a specific workflow to accomplish a task\n- Coordinate specialized agents to build an agentic podcast workflow that researches topics and produces multi-speaker audio\n- Understand how to deploy an agent into production\n\nEven if you’re not yet building voice systems, you'll find understanding how realtime agents stream data and maintain reliability useful for designing modern agentic applications.\n\nPlease join here: https://lnkd.in/ga6tD5rt",

      "content": "I initially thought Revolut was an excellent online bank with a user-friendly iOS app and no fees. However, upon further experience, I discovered that their business practices involve questionable methods, such as using customers' funds without permission to purchase Revolut points.\nIt's disheartening to see a fintech company that has grown from a startup to a widely used online bank resort to earning profits in this manner. Despite receiving a refund, I will continue to monitor my account closely. If this issue persists, I will update this post and remove all my assets from Revolut, ultimately adding them to my blocked list.\n\nSome updates so far on 14th of Oct. I have got my fully refund from Revolut promptly，even earlier than my reply in this post. #Kudos to their customer service for their swift response and commitment to resolving the issue. While my experience wasn't ideal this time, Revolut remains a standout fintech company, offering support for #ApplePay, #GooglePay, #SamsungPay, and more through their visual cards. Most people appreciate the convenience of having a digital wallet on their phones, and Revolut fits the bill, especially for those who don't want to link their main bank accounts directly to Apple or Google Pay.\n\nWhat's more, their <18 feature allows you to apply and manage a kid's visual card through Revolut App from your own account – a game-changer for parents like us without local country‘s citizenship or passports. Despite any shortcomings, Revolut's innovative spirit is commendable, and I wish them continued success in revolutionizing the virtual finance landscape.\n\n#Revolut #BusinessModel #Fintech #WatchYourMoney",

      "content": "#Tesla \"True Unboxed Process 2.0\" patent (US 12420879 B1) \nwas granted and published today.\nWe are moving closer and closer to the real-life mass production of Matchbox cars. \n\nAbstract/Summary: The patent describes a revolutionary departure from traditional linear assembly lines (e.g., Ford's conveyor-belt model). Instead, it uses a modular \"unboxed\" architecture where vehicle components are built in parallel sub-assembly lines as independent modules (e.g., front, rear, underbody with battery, and sides/roof). These modules are pre-assembled, \"decorated\" (e.g., painted or finished), and then integrated in a final \"mainline\" step. This reduces sequential dependencies, enabling:\nParallel processing to cut cycle times.\nReduced factory footprint by up to 40%.\nCost savings of 30-50% per vehicle through fewer parts, less material waste, and automation-friendly designs. The process integrates Tesla's giga-casting (large single-piece castings for underbody) and structural battery packs, allowing seats and wiring to be installed directly on modules before final joining.",

Through relentless performance tuning and strategic hardware optimization on our on-premise Dell HPC, our dream team of hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, and system architects just accomplished what many deemed impossible:\n\n📈 The fastest #Android15AOSP clean build time on the #BareMetal we've ever achieved.\nLet the numbers do the talking:\nOur breakthrough: 7.78 minutes ⚡\nPrevious baseline: 27 minutes (3.5x improvement!)\n#Google's official benchmark: ~40 minutes (72 cores + 64GB RAM)\n#Azure VM HB120rs_v3 (their best): ~20.18 minutes (AMD EPYC 7V73X, 120 vCPUs, 448GB HBM2, 350GB/s memory bandwidth + Premium NVMe + InfiniBand HDR networking)\n\nWe didn't just beat #Azure's flagship HPC instance — we CRUSHED it by 259%! 💪 Here's the kicker: Our previous virtualized results with #VMware were trailing behind Azure significantly. Now? We've leapfrogged them entirely through pure engineering excellence.\nThe secret sauce? Well, like any five-star chef's recipe, that stays in the vault：）But here's the gist — it's not about throwing expensive hardware at the problem. It's about dissecting every layer of the stack and optimizing with surgical precision.\n\nWhy This Matters: #Tesla didn't become the EV leader by just matching competitors — they made their cars cooler, smarter, and more advanced. Similarly, we're not just optimizing build times; we're redefining what's possible in our development pipeline and setting up our own private cloud in our #DataCenter as well.\nAs the Olympic motto says: Citius, Altius, Fortius — Faster, Higher, Stronger. There are no shortcuts to peak performance, only dedication to excellence.\nReady to transform your development velocity? The future of high-performance computing isn't in the cloud — it's in knowing how to make silicon sing.\n\nP.S. — The visualization of #TeslaMCU3 was crafted using advanced prompts +#GeminiNanoBanana.

      "content": "Tonight, I successfully renewed my Finansiell ID-Teknik - BankID  using the SEB mobile app in just 25 seconds. I was prompted to do so because my BankID was about to expire in 57 days. However, my wife is facing issues installing BankID on her new #iPhone17 due to a defect in the ICA Banken's app on #iPhoneX. We contacted ICA Banken's call center, and they asked us to wait for an in-app message. Unfortunately, after two weeks waiting, with their instructions, we're still stuck in a loop when trying to sign with BankID for authenticating the installation of new BankID on new iPhone, basically nothing being changed. Following the call center's suggestion, we booked an appointment with SEB tomorrow. We might have to close our ICA Banken account, as they don't seem to care about our issue and advised us to find a bank with a physical office.\nSometimes, businesses overlook customer complaints about their products or services, believing that losing one customer isn't a big deal. However, the negative impact of such experiences goes beyond just one customer, as it spreads through word-of-mouth and online reviews.\nWith virtual banks like Revolut emerging, the advantages of traditional banks are becoming less obvious. When customers are charged 20 SEK per month and find that their app isn't compatible with new devices, it's only natural for them to switch to other banks. \nThis experience serves as a reminder that businesses can't afford to become complacent. Failing to continuously improve products and services will inevitably result in losing customers, as they seek better alternatives. Ultimately, prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying ahead of the competition are key to long-term success.\n\n#ICABanken #BankID #SEB #Revolution #CustomerService",

      "content": "There’s been a lot of buzz around NVIDIA DGX Spark since October 15th, so let’s talk about two compact #BareMetals that keep coming up in comparison: NVIDIA’s DGX Spark and Apple’s Mac mini M4 Pro.\nHere are my observations:\n🔹 Mac mini M4 Pro\n• \t64GB unified memory\n• \tmacOS 26 “Tahoe”\n• \tSeamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem\n• \tCompact, quiet, and versatile\n🔹 NVIDIA DGX Spark\n• \t128GB RAM\n• \t4TB SSD\n• \t~273GB/s memory bandwidth\n• \tRuns a customized Ubuntu 24 Linux OS\nBoth machines deliver impressive AI performance (roughly comparable to an RTX 3090 Ti in some scenarios). But their focus is different:\n• \tDGX Spark is clearly aimed at professionals running heavy AI/ML workloads. The extra RAM and storage make it a specialized tool for model training and large‑scale experiments.\n• \tMac mini M4 Pro is an all‑rounder. It’s perfect for those who want a premium desktop that handles everyday tasks effortlessly while still being capable of serious compute work. The Apple ecosystem and macOS polish make it a smooth experience.\n💡 So which one makes sense?\n• \tIf your priority is intensive AI/ML modeling, DGX Spark is the better fit.\n• \tIf you want a versatile, user‑friendly system that balances performance with everyday usability, the Mac mini M4 Pro is hard to beat.\nFor me personally, I don’t see a reason to choose the DGX Spark at this price point. There are more cost‑effective alternatives out there — for example:\n👉 https://lnkd.in/dmrJ-pjp\nDon’t get blinded by the NVIDIA halo effect. Choose what truly fits your needs. If it were up to me, I’d go with the Mac mini M4 Pro (64GB / 2TB).\n\nResources:\n1. \thttps://lnkd.in/d7Ct_CFS\n2. \thttps://lnkd.in/dUNNav3T\n\n#NVIDIA #DGXSpark #Apple #MacMiniM4Pro #Ubuntu24 #macOS26Tahoe #MachineLearning #AIHardware",

See our new short course: \"Building Live Voice Agents with Google’s ADK (Agent Development Kit),”  taught by Google’s Lavi Nigam and Sita Lakshmi Sangameswaran. \n\nADK provides modular components that make it easy to build and debug agents. It also includes a built-in web interface for tracing agentic reasoning. This course illustrates these concepts via  building a live voice agent that can chain actions to complete a complex task like creating a podcast. This requires maintaining context, implementing guardrails, reasoning, and handling audio streaming, while keeping latency low.\n\nYou’ll learn to:\n- Build voice agents that listen, reason, and respond\n- Guide your agent to follow a specific workflow to accomplish a task\n- Coordinate specialized agents to build an agentic podcast workflow that researches topics and produces multi-speaker audio\n- Understand how to deploy an agent into production\n\nEven if you’re not yet building voice systems, you'll find understanding how realtime agents stream data and maintain reliability useful for designing modern agentic applications.\n\nPlease join here: https://lnkd.in/ga6tD5rt",

      "content": "I initially thought Revolut was an excellent online bank with a user-friendly iOS app and no fees. However, upon further experience, I discovered that their business practices involve questionable methods, such as using customers' funds without permission to purchase Revolut points.\nIt's disheartening to see a fintech company that has grown from a startup to a widely used online bank resort to earning profits in this manner. Despite receiving a refund, I will continue to monitor my account closely. If this issue persists, I will update this post and remove all my assets from Revolut, ultimately adding them to my blocked list.\n\nSome updates so far on 14th of Oct. I have got my fully refund from Revolut promptly，even earlier than my reply in this post. #Kudos to their customer service for their swift response and commitment to resolving the issue. While my experience wasn't ideal this time, Revolut remains a standout fintech company, offering support for #ApplePay, #GooglePay, #SamsungPay, and more through their visual cards. Most people appreciate the convenience of having a digital wallet on their phones, and Revolut fits the bill, especially for those who don't want to link their main bank accounts directly to Apple or Google Pay.\n\nWhat's more, their <18 feature allows you to apply and manage a kid's visual card through Revolut App from your own account – a game-changer for parents like us without local country‘s citizenship or passports. Despite any shortcomings, Revolut's innovative spirit is commendable, and I wish them continued success in revolutionizing the virtual finance landscape.\n\n#Revolut #BusinessModel #Fintech #WatchYourMoney",

      "content": "#Tesla \"True Unboxed Process 2.0\" patent (US 12420879 B1) \nwas granted and published today.\nWe are moving closer and closer to the real-life mass production of Matchbox cars. \n\nAbstract/Summary: The patent describes a revolutionary departure from traditional linear assembly lines (e.g., Ford's conveyor-belt model). Instead, it uses a modular \"unboxed\" architecture where vehicle components are built in parallel sub-assembly lines as independent modules (e.g., front, rear, underbody with battery, and sides/roof). These modules are pre-assembled, \"decorated\" (e.g., painted or finished), and then integrated in a final \"mainline\" step. This reduces sequential dependencies, enabling:\nParallel processing to cut cycle times.\nReduced factory footprint by up to 40%.\nCost savings of 30-50% per vehicle through fewer parts, less material waste, and automation-friendly designs. The process integrates Tesla's giga-casting (large single-piece castings for underbody) and structural battery packs, allowing seats and wiring to be installed directly on modules before final joining.",

      "content": "🚀 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! \nAs promised, here are the results that left the team speechless. Through relentless performance tuning and strategic hardware optimization on our on-premise Dell HPC, our dream team of hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, and system architects just accomplished what many deemed impossible:\n\n📈 The fastest #Android15AOSP clean build time on the #BareMetal we've ever achieved.\nLet the numbers do the talking:\nOur breakthrough: 7.78 minutes ⚡\nPrevious baseline: 27 minutes (3.5x improvement!)\n#Google's official benchmark: ~40 minutes (72 cores + 64GB RAM)\n#Azure VM HB120rs_v3 (their best): ~20.18 minutes (AMD EPYC 7V73X, 120 vCPUs, 448GB HBM2, 350GB/s memory bandwidth + Premium NVMe + InfiniBand HDR networking)\n\nWe didn't just beat #Azure's flagship HPC instance — we CRUSHED it by 259%! 💪 Here's the kicker: Our previous virtualized results with #VMware were trailing behind Azure significantly. Now? We've leapfrogged them entirely through pure engineering excellence.\nThe secret sauce? Well, like any five-star chef's recipe, that stays in the vault：）But here's the gist — it's not about throwing expensive hardware at the problem. It's about dissecting every layer of the stack and optimizing with surgical precision.\n\nWhy This Matters: #Tesla didn't become the EV leader by just matching competitors — they made their cars cooler, smarter, and more advanced. Similarly, we're not just optimizing build times; we're redefining what's possible in our development pipeline and setting up our own private cloud in our #DataCenter as well.\nAs the Olympic motto says: Citius, Altius, Fortius — Faster, Higher, Stronger. There are no shortcuts to peak performance, only dedication to excellence.\nReady to transform your development velocity? The future of high-performance computing isn't in the cloud — it's in knowing how to make silicon sing.\n\nP.S. — The visualization of #TeslaMCU3 was crafted using advanced prompts +#GeminiNanoBanana. Like our optimization techniques, some secrets are meant to be sensed, not explained. \n\n#Android15 #DellServer #HPC #AOSP #PerformanceTuning #DevOps  #AndroidAuto #TechInnovation #BuildOptimization #AzureAKS #GCP #HybridCloud #PrivateCloud #TeslaMCU #AMDRyzen",
